- # Component Styling
  - Let shadcn/ui and theme handle default spacing, sizing, and colors - only add classes when deviating from defaults
  - Avoid redundant classes: `border-border`, `text-foreground`, `variant="default"`, fixed widths, unnecessary flex/gap/margin/pad
- when working with cloud functions, always read online about cloud functions v2 implementation since it is very new.
